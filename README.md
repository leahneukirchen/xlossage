# xlossage, display pressed keys in X11 in a readable way

xlossage is a tool to display X11 keypresses in an Emacs-like manner
(cf. M-x view-lossage).  It's primary use is to support screencasts.

NOTE: The xlossage output can contain sensitive information.  Use with care.

## Limitations

* Hardcoded modifier masks (can this be done without mind reading?)

## Copyright

xlossage contains parts lifted from xorg-xinput:
